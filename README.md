#####Body#####

1. PERSECUTION Impeached, as a Traytor against GOD, His Laws and Government: And the Cause of the Ancient MARTYRS vindicated, against the Cruelty inflicted upon them by the Papists in former dayes.

    _ And first, I shall shew a little concerning the signification of the term Phauatick, as of late used; and the first use of it in these late dayes; and the exchange of the word from one sort to another; and in whose mouths it now remains; and who are now so accounted.

      * VI.

      * VII.

      * VIII.

    _ Secondly, I shall now shew how maliciously the nameless Author of Semper Iidem hath slandered the Martyrs and Sufferers for Righteousness sake in former Ages; and how he hath accused the Protestants (now living) and what effect this would work in England, if the Author's Intent were fulfilled.

      * I.

      * VIII.

    _ Thirdly, I shall now shew how this spirit in the Papists, that burnt the Martyrs, (which is the same spirit that endited Semper Iidem, that is again moving its Countenance now adayes) I shall shew how that spirit was not, nor is of Christ, but of Antichrist and the Devil.

      * VII.

      * VIII.

    _ Now I come to search some particulars, which are stated pag. 3. which it's said John Wickliff held; which Doctrines the Author of Semper Iidem seems to say are Errors, by his condemning such for Hereticks as held them for Truths.

    _ And now, last of all, for Conclusion, I have some CONSIDERATIONS to present to the People of England, and particularly to the People of London, occasioned by the Publication of Semper Iidem.
